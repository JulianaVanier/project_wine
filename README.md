Final project - Web Programming - Vanier College Teacher Peter Ng

# Description
The Wine API Web Application represents an immersive web endeavor conceived within the realm of a web programming course. It serves as an educational gateway, acquainting students with a diverse spectrum of fundamental principles. These encompass harnessing the Fetch API, dynamically fabricating content, and seamlessly integrating SVG graphics to orchestrate an interactive and aesthetically pleasing user journey. Predominantly, our endeavor revolves around the adept utilization of the Fetch API to fetch wine-related data from an external source and showcase one randomly selected product per instance. Furthermore, this project sets out to elucidate the incorporation of SVG graphics within web pages, elucidating both its advantages and limitations.​​​​​​​
